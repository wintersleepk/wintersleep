# ❄️ wintersleep

👋 Hi, I'm Winter — a B.Tech AI/ML student who writes **secure C code**, builds **CLI tools**, and is slowly conquering the Linux terminal.

### 🔧 What I Do
- 🌐 Build CLI tools in C (password managers, encrypted notes, secure file I/O)
- 🔐 Implement AES & SHA256 using OpenSSL
- 💻 Learn Networking & Rust (with zero sleep)

### 📦 Projects Coming Soon
- Password Vault (C + AES-256-CBC)
- JSON-based ToDo + Notes App (C + cJSON)
- File Encryptor (CLI tool)

### 🚀 Tech Stack
`C` | `Linux` | `OpenSSL` | `Bash` | `Git` | `JSON (cJSON)` | `Rust` *(learning)*

### 🛠️ Currently Building
My GitHub. From scratch. With caffeine.
